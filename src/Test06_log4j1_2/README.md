Introduction
=============

This package's code are mainly from <http://www.blogjava.net/hellxoul/archive/2011/11/30/365181.html/>, but which is almost deprecated because now log4j 2 is popular. 

To build the source of this package successfully, the log4j 1.2 is needed. So, download it from [here](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/logging/log4j/1.2.17/log4j-1.2.17.tar.gz), and then unpact the tar.gz file and add the location of log4j-1.2.17.jar to classpath or Eclipse's External jars.
